# Fullstack Photo Sharing Social Media Web App

I've developed a fullstack photo sharing social media web app (Instagram Clone) using React, TailwindCSS, Material UI & Firebase. Users can post photos with caption & comment on photos.

I've used Firebase as the backend for database, user authentication & photo storage. Only logged in users are allowed to post, using Auth Listeners for the same.
